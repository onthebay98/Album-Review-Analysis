# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are...

Project idea #1:
Scrape the ~17000 album reviews (grades) from https://www.robertchristgau.com/cg.php to test the following hypothesis: Christgau has become increasingly lenient in his album grading with his advanced age. Using the same data, we could also train a model to see if the letter grade can be inferred from sentiment analysis of the written review.

Project idea #2:
Does marijuana legalization cause more fast-food joints to pop up? Perform a difference-in-difference analysis to see if the prevalence of fast-food locations increased at a higher proportion in states that legalized marijuana versus states that didn’t. We’ll use Python to perform the statistical analysis and make some pretty (interactive?) plots.

Project idea #3 (Optional):
Take a Shakespeare play and build an “Organizational Network Analysis” to see who interacts with who most frequently. The end product would be a graph of nodes that represent each character with the connections representing the frequency of the interaction.

I'm picking Project Idea #1

By the end of week 4, Learned how to scrape a website
By the end of week 5, Scraped all the data I need from the site
By the end of week 6, I will have performed the analysis for the hypothesis I noted
By the end of week 7, Started to train a model for the sentiment analysis
By the end of week 8, Finished all analysis, drawn conclusions
Finally, I will make my results pretty and understandable
